Notes:

Ignore the BSDMakefile, it is there for reference only.  Instead, use the 
Makefile, which can be run by nmake.  It is simplest to do this from the
Visual Studio developers shell, or from a batch script that "call"s the
script which sets the environmental variables.

The Makefile may have to be edited, to update the location of the regex  
library.  Currently, Gnu regex is used, avaialable from GnuWin32, see
Depeendencies.

I think I made some destructive changes, so at this point this should be
considered a fork of the BSD ed.  The difference is largely academic, since
upstream lies FreeBSD, who would be unlikely to accept #ifdef WIN32 style
commits anyway.  

Dependencies:

Currently, the main dependency is gnu regex, everything else has kind of 
been hobbled together inside of the package.  The FreeBSD regex code has
been tied to its rune code, which I am not going to try to port.  However,
the regex code has an earlier form, which is not tied to the runes, which
is probably worth an attempt at porting.  It has more of a combined zlib
and BSD style license, which although unusual, should be quite ok.
